I'm Yiyu Liu, an imcoming PhD student in Computer Science and also an amateur
photographer.
For my research profile, please visit my [homepage](https://lau.yeeyu.org/).

Photography differs from real life in that it captures a still moment.
This static nature creates a sense of artistry, as the distance between
the photograph and reality allows for the expression of something unique.
Elements such as exposure time, camera perspective, focal length, and bokeh
work together to shape an image that, while reminiscent of reality, is
inherently distinct.

Video, in contrast, represent a flow of moments; yet they also maintain a
certain separation from reality. This is achieved through techniques like
montage[^1], camera angles and positioning, clip duration, and background
sound, among others. Videos often convey richer ideas and emotions, making
them even more meaningful than still images.

I am deeply interested in the art of photography and videography, and I'd
love to share some of my photos and videos with you.
Since photos takes less effort to create, I'll be sharing more of them.

I hope you enjoy the photos and videos I share here!

## Site Name: I Am What I Am

The name comes from *Exodus 3:14* in the Hebrew Bible---"I Am That I Am", or
"I am what I am"---a declaration of self-existence and identity.
Nevertheless, I first encountered it through Leslie Cheung's song *æˆ‘ (I)*,
which gave the phrase a personal, emotional meaning: the courage to be oneself.
