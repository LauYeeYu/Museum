The pictures are all taken with my Sony ILCE-7M4 camera (Tamron 28--75mm
f/2.8 Di III VXD G2 lens and Sigma 100--400mm f/5.6--6.3 DG DN OS lens).

## Amber Twilight

On a Mid-Autumn Festival evening, I took this photo---*Amber Twilight*.
The amber glow with the clean fantasy-like blue in the sky
and the water creates a mixed but harmonious colour palette.

## Gilded Canyon

This photo, *Gilded Canyon*, captures the evening vibe of the metropolis, Shanghai.
The wet street acts as a mirror, beautifully reflecting the "mixed colours"
of the warm amber-lit architecture and the cool blue high-rise buildings in the
background.

## The Way to the Water

This photo, *The Way to the Water*, grasps the chill atmosphere of Bainbridge Island.
A cool, azure light washes over the entire scene, tinting the road, trees,
and bushes as they all wind down to the water.

## The Waiting Stadium

*The Waiting Stadium* was captured before the football game at Husky Stadium
against UCLA. The spotlights tear through the blue-hour sky, building a
tense atmosphere before the game starts. The warm amber light outside the stadium
contrasts with the cool blue sky, creating a striking visual effect.

## Bellevue at Dusk

The photo, *Bellevue at Dusk*, depicts the beauty of the scene from Seattle to
Bellevue at dusk. A soft amber light shines onto the 520 bridge and the
buildings in Bellevue, blended with the sky with colours from warm to cool.
The golden sunlight with the blue tones in Lake Washington and sky creates
a contrasting yet harmonious colour scheme.

## Tahoma

*Tahoma* was the indigenous name of Mount Rainier, meaning "mother of waters" or
"large snowy mountain". The mountain is covered with snow all year round, and can be
viewed almost anywhere in the Seattle area on a clear day. This photo captures
the stunning view of Mount Rainier during the golden hour, with warm amber light
illuminating the snowy peak, contrasting beautifully against the deep blue sky.
