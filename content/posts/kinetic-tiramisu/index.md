On 13 September 2025, I spent my afternoon at Constitution Beach in East
Boston, MA, USA, photographing aircraft approaching and taxiing at
Boston Logan International Airport (BOS/KBOS). The view at the beach is
fantastic, with seagulls flying around and a lot of aircraft in the sky
and on the ground.

All pictures are captured with my Sony ILCE-7M4 camera and Sigma 100--400mm
F/5.6--6.3 DG DN OS lens.

## Spotlights

### The Long Goodbye: Farewell to the Flying Pencil

The Airbus A340-600 is one of the few four-engine aeroplanes still in
operation. What makes it even more special (or specifically, tragic) is
that only Lufthansa operates this type of aircraft as passenger aircraft,
and they have planned to retire them at the start of 2026. Therefore, the
main purpose of this activity was to photograph this aircraft type before
it is gone from the sky forever. Here it comes!

### A380 Touchdown

The Airbus A380 is the largest passenger aircraft in the world. It has
two full decks and four engines. It is a magnificent sight to see one of
these giants touching down on runway 22L.

### "Of the Same Size"

The Airbus A380 should be much larger than the Airbus A319, but in this
picture, because of the perspective, they appear to be of the same size.
On runway 22L, the jumbo jet A380 (left) was much farther away from the
camera than the A319 (right), which was taxiing on taxiway N. Coincidentally,
both aircraft have similar winglets, and the height of the fuselage as
well as the vertical fin is on the same level in this picture, making them
more likely to be perceived as the same size.

### Dunkin' Livery

Dunkin' is a popular coffee and donut chain in the Greater Boston area.
What a surprise to see such a special livery on a JetBlue aircraft!

## Condor Livery

Condor features a series of colourful liveries on their aircraft. The livery of
this Airbus A330-941 is called "Beige Beach".

### Simultaneous Takeoff and Landing

while an Air France Airbus A350 (right) is braking with thrust reversal deployed on Runway 22L.
