## The Story

A student is about to graduate, feeling disoriented and unsure about the
future. Walking past a familiar classroom building, he slows down, and steps
inside then. Memories from the past four years rise like a tide---moments of
lectures, group projects, and burning the midnight oil,
flicker through his mind as if they just happened yesterday.
The first interlude begins, filled with movement that echoes the changes
in who he has become.

Slowly, his role shifts. No longer just a learner, he becomes a teaching
assistant and a researcher.
The scene moves through different laboratories, each alive with experiments
and ideas, all bound together by the shared dedication and passion.
As the robot stands up firmly for the first time, it mirrors his own journey
of growth and transformation.

Another interlude follows, full of joy and excitement, as he remembers
the scene of taking graduation photos.
Happiness pushes away the doubts that once weighed on him.
He runs back to his dorm, pulls on his academic dress, and visits the
places that shaped his journey---with hope and confidence shining in his
eyes this time.

Finally, he walks out of the university with a suitcase in hand.
Behind him are the walls that held his youth; ahead is a wide, open road.
With the memories of the past and the dreams of tomorrow, he steps forward
into the unknown, ready for what comes next.
