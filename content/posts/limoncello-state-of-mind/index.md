The pictures are all taken with my Sony ILCE-7M4 camera (Tamron 28--75mm
f/2.8 Di III VXD G2 lens and Sigma 100--400mm f/5.6--6.3 DG DN OS lens).

## The Last Glow

On the twilight of the Fourth of July, before the fireworks started,
I took this photo---*The Last Glow*. The last warm light casts a smooth yet
intense glow over the cityscape of Seattle, creating a beautiful contrast
with the cool blue sky.

## A Moment of Stillness

Captured moments before The Last Glow, this image---*A Moment of
Stillness*---finds the harbor at rest. Boats float peacefully in Lake Union,
reflecting the quiet blue of the sky above. The blend of scattered amber
lights and deep cool tones evokes a sense of calm, as if time itself has
paused for a brief moment.

## Grey Awakening

Seattle is defined by its signature clouds, a mood locals simply call 'The
Grey.' This kind of weather creates a unique atmosphere, captured here in
*Grey Awakening*. It casts a sleepy feeling over the streets, softening the
noise of the city and allowing the mind to pause, even if just for a moment.

## Golden Static

*Golden Static*. Caught between day and night, warm light spreads across a cloudy
sky. The golden glowing hues against the cool street creates a static golden
moment---a breath of calm in the wires.

## Melting Colours
At Constitution Beach, near Boston Logan, the sky and sea dissolve into one
another in *Melting Colours*. The terminal and grounded aircraft sit in
stillness, with another airplane ascending, creating a sense of slowly passing
time. The gradient---shifting from warm citrus tones to cool blue---bringing a
feeling that is both smooth and intense, mirroring the very essence of
limoncello.
