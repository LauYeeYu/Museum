In December 2025, I travelled to Maui, Hawaiʻi for a short vacation.
The island's stunning beaches, vibrant sunsets, and fantastic landscapes
provided great opportunities for photography. The photographs in this post
capture the beauty of Maui, showcasing its unique charm and the warm spirit
of Aloha.
