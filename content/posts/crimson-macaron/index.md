On 13 March 2025, a total lunar eclipse occurred, which can be viewed in
North America. This rare celestial event was a spectacular sight to behold.
The bright section of the moon gradually dimmed and turned a deep red color,
earning it the nickname "Blood Moon".

The pictures are all captured with my Sony ILCE-7M4 camera and Sigma 100-400mm
